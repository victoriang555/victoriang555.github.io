title: Medical Attention Information Assistance- Predictive Perspective
---

### Should I Seek Medical Attention?

Have you ever searched webmd or other related websites to determine whether your
aches and pains were doctor's visit worthy? I have! If you have, have you noticed
that most symptoms could've resulted from pretty much any illness, whether it's
as minor as intestinal gas buildup to colon cancer. It's scary making the decision
of whether to seek medical attention- especially when it's expensive to do so. 

### Overview of Project
This project seeks to predict the outcome of an adverse reaction to consuming a 
food, drug, or cosmetic product. I wanted to help consumers make a better informed
decision using predictions made from my predictive model.

### Methodology
1. KNN to conduct language classification for feature engineering
2. PCA to reduce dimensions of vectorized corpus for feature engineering
3. Random Forest ensemble for final modeling

### Tools Utilized
1. Python & HTML5
2. pandas
3. scikitlearn
4. flask
5. wikipedia
6. matplotlib

### Features
1. Accuracy is 17% better than the dummy model.
2. Overfits in order to have more evenly distributed recall across the targets


### Conclusion
Looking forward, I'd like to
1. Use a layered ensemble method
2. Use class weighting
3. Use grouped outcomes 
4. Make the user interface more user friendly
